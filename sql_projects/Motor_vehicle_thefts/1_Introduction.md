# Motor Vehicle Thefts Analysis

I've just been hired as a Data Analust for the New Zeland police department to help raise awareness about motor vehicle thefts.

For this analysis I will use MySQL, MS Excel, MS Excel formulas MS Excel charts.

## Scenario
The police department plans to release a public service announcement to encourage citizens to be aware of thefts and stay safe. 

## Goal
I have been asked to dig into the stolen vehicles database to find details on when, which and where vehicles are most likely to be stolen.

During the analysis I'm going to answer the following questions:

1. What day of the week are vehicles most often and least often stolen?

2. What types of vehicles are most often and least often stolen? Does this vary by region?

3. What is the average age of the vehicles that are stolen? Does this vary based on the vehicle type?

4. Which regions have the most and least number of stolen vehicles? What are the characteristics of the regions?

## Objectives
1. Identify when vehicles are likely to be stolen
2. Identify which vehicles are likely to be stolen
3. Identify where vehicles are likely to be stolen

## Data Overview
Stolen vehicle data from the New Zealand police department's vehicle of interest database containing 6 months of data. Each record represents a single stolen vehicle, with data on vehicle type, make, year, color, date stolen and region stolen.

Multiple tables. # of records 4,707. # of fields 14.
