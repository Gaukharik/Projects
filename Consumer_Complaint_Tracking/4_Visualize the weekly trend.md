## Visualize the weekly trend 

My final objective is to add formatting and polish to the report by modifying the KPIs, chart, and timeline filter.

1. Calculate the count of Complaint ID by Status (columns) and Year, Month, and Day (rows) and create a stacked column chart with the results to visualize the weekly trend.

To calculate the count of Complaint ID by Status (columns) and Year, Month, and Day (rows) we need to add second PivotTable:

![](/Consumer_Complaint_Tracking/screenshots/obj3_task1.png)

Then from this pivot table we can add stacked column chart:

![](/Consumer_Complaint_Tracking/screenshots/obj3_task1_1.png)

2. Connect the chart to the Week start timeline filter.

This is the result of connecting the chart to the Week start timeline filter:

![](/Consumer_Complaint_Tracking/screenshots/obj3_task2.png)

3. Place the “Open” column in the chart at the baseline to improve readability.

We just moved “Open” column in the chart in the beggining:

![](/Consumer_Complaint_Tracking/screenshots/obj3_task3.png)

4. Use the colors in the “Open” and “Closed” KPIs as a legend for the chart and apply additional formatting and alignment to finalize the report.

After using the colors in the “Open” and “Closed” KPIs as a legend for the chart and applying additional formatting and alignment to finalize the report our final dashboard looks like this:

![](/Consumer_Complaint_Tracking/screenshots/result_dashboard.png)

We had a huge peak at almost 800 complaints in July and maybe it's because of the 4th of July weekend that people, tried to use their credit cards or spend a lot more money somehow. So we got a lot more complaints this week and it looks like we've been playing catch up, trying to close all off the complaints that were opened.
