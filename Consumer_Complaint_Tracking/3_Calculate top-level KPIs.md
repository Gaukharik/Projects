## Calculate top-level KPIs

My second objective is to create a new PivotTable that shows the "Open" and "Closed" complaints by week, then visualize the trend using a stacked column chart.

1. Calculate the count of Complaint ID by Status, including the grand total.

So the easiest way to do that is to add PivotTable:

![](/Consumer_Complaint_Tracking/screenshots/status_pivot.png)

2. Place the results, or KPIs, in a single row with “Complaints:” to their left.

To do that we just need to move Status from rows to columns filed:

![](/Consumer_Complaint_Tracking/screenshots/task_2.png)

3. Add a title on top (“Consumer Complaints Tracking”) and apply formatting to the title & KPIs.

The result of adding a title on top (“Consumer Complaints Tracking”) and applying formatting to the title & KPIs is the following:

![](/Consumer_Complaint_Tracking/screenshots/task_3.png)

4. Insert a timeline with the Week start field to filter the results.
