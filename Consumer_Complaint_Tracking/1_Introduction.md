# Consumer Complaints Tracking

I just have been hired as a Business Intelligence (BI) Developer for the Compliance Department at Bank of America.

For this analysis, I will use MS Excel, PivotTables and Pivot Charts. 

## Scenario
My team receives consumer complaints from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and is expected to handle them appropriately and swiftly.

## Goal
I have been asked to create a report to track open and closed complaints for a specific period and visualize the weekly trend to avoid overdue complaints. 

During the analysis I'm going to answer the following questions:

1. Do consumer complaints show any seasonal patterns?

2. Which products present the most complaints? What are its most common issues?

3. How are complaints typically resolved?

## Objectives
1. Create calculated columns 
2. Calculate top-level KPIs
3. Visualize the weekly trend

## Data Overview
Single table, # of records 62,516, # of fields 12.
