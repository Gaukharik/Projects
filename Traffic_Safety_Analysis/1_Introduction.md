# Traffic Safety Analysis

I've just joined the analytics taskforce of the Ne York City Poilce Department as they look to analyze traffic accident data for the city's Public Safety initiative.

For this analysis, I will use MS Excel, conditional formatting, MS Excel formulas, PivotTables. 

## Scenario
My team has access to data on all the traffic accidents in New York City from January 1st,2021 up to April 9th,2023. 

## Goal
My task is to analyze the data with the purpose of finding interesting patterns and trends to help NYPD prevent future accidents.

During the analysis I'm going to answer the following questions:

1. Compare the % of total accidents by month. Do you notice any seasonal patterns?

2. Break down accident frequency by day of week and hour of day. Based on this data, when do accidents occur most frequently?

3. On which particular street were the most accidents reported? What does that represent as a % of all reported accidents?

4. What was the most common contributing factor for the accidents reported? What about for fatal accidents specifically?

## Objectives
1. Identify seasonal patterns
2. Visualize weekly trends
3. Analyze contributing factors

## Data Overview
Motor vehicle collisions reported by the New York City Police Department from January 2021 to April 2023. Each record represents an individual collision, including the date, time, and location of the accident (borough, zip code, street name, latitude/longitude), vehicles and victims involved, and contributing factors.

Single table. # of records 238,421. # of fields 18.
