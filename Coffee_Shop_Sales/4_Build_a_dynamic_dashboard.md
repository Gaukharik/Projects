## Build a dynamic dashboard

My final objective is to visualize the data with Pivot Charts, design an interactive dashboard, and identify insights and recommendations for the coffee shop.

So this is how our final dashboard looks like. 

1. We added Pivot Charts to show revenue by month as a line chart, transactions by day of week and hour of day as column charts, and transactions by product category as a bar chart.

2. We assembled the charts into a rough dashboard layout, and include space for the PivotTable showing Top 15 product types.

3. Added a slicer for store location, and connected it to all of the PivotTables on the sheet.

4. Adjusted formatting, alignment and polish to finalize the dashboard.

So do I notice any interesting patterns or trends? 

I can see some really interesting patterns by day of week and by hour of day.

In Lower Manhattan, we see a huge spike, which seems to be during the morning commute, that 7 to 10 AM hour. 

Major spike in sales on Monday, and then towards the evening 7 and 8 PM mark they really not selling much product at all. So interesting insight here may be that, they are loosing money by keeping the store open past 6 o'clock. Maybe company can improve margins by changing their operating hours.

We start to see some interesting product level trends. So here in Manhattan, the espresso seems to be very popular. Coffee and tea are the top products. 

Let's compare that against Astoria.

We can see that the chai tea is actually the most important product or the most sold product. 
Again coffee and tea at the top of the list. 

We don't quite see that the same traffic on Monday in Astoria. There is a pattern, but not quite as extreme as Manhattan. 

And looks like this location stays open till 7 and transactions stay pretty stable throughout the day, all the way down to closing time.
