## Prepare the data for analysis

My  second objective is to slice and dice the coffee shop data with Excel PivotTables, and create views to analyze time series and product-level trends.

1. Insert a PivotTable on a new tab to show revenue by month

So we added pivot table with revenue by month. 

2. Add two more PivotTables (on the same sheet) to show the number of transactions by day of week and by hour of day

We added two more PivotTables to show the number of transactions by day of week and by hour of day.

3. Add a PivotTable (on the same sheet) to show the number of transactions by product category, sorted descending by transactions

We added PivotTable to show the number of transactions by product category, sorted descending by transactions.

4. Add a PivotTable (on the same sheet) to show the number of transactions and revenue by product type, sorted descending and filtered to the Top 15 (by transactions)

And we added last PivotTable to show the number of transactions and revenue by product type, sorted descending and filtered to the Top 15 (by transactions).
