# HR Survey Analysis

Seatle Department of Public Works. 

For this analysis, I will use MS Excel, PowerPivot. 

## Scenario
I've been just hired as a Human Resource (HR) Associate for the Seatle Department of Public Works.
The city recently surveyed around 1,500 public works employees to measure job satisfaction and identify opportunities to keep staff motivated and engaged.

## Goal
I have been asked to analyze the survey response data, and prepare a visual summary for the HR leadership team.

I'm going to answer the following questions:

1. Which survey questions did respondents agree with or disagree with most?

2. Do you see any patterns or trends by department or role?

3. As an employer, what steps might you take to improve employee satisfaction based on the survey results?

## Objectives
1. Explore and profile the data to correct any quality issues
2. Prepare and reformat the data for visualization
3. Visualize the data and identify key insights and recommendations.

## Data Overview
Actual responses from an employee engagement survey conducted by Pierce County WA and completed voluntarily by government employees.
Single table. # of records 14,725. # of fields 10.
