## Visualize the data and summarize findings

My final objective is to visualize the data using stacked bar charts and Likert scales, and derive insights and recommendations to share with the HR leadership team based on your findings.

1. Visualize the percentages as a 100% stacked bar chart, showing the question with the highest average response at the top

2. Update colors to shades of orange or red for negative responses (1,2), and shades of blue for positive responses (3,4)

3. Add data labels and remove the x-axis, title and vertical gridlines, then format individual chart elements to improve readability

4. Based on your findings, what insights or recommendations might you bring to the HR leadership team?

Looking at this chart it seems like supervisors are doing great job setting clear expectations.

Looks like employers are feeling cared for and motivated to do their best work every day. These are things we want to continue to promote and encourage. 

But on the other end of the spectrum, there may be some opportunities to perhaps foster some closer connections between collegues. Very few people are saying that they have a best friend at work, so I might recommend more social or corporate networking events as an example. 

And also looks like employees might be seeking a bit more public recognition, so I might recommend finding opportunities to showcase and reinforce great work with the broader team just as a way to keep staff motivated and engaged.
