I've just been hired as a Data Analust for a popular baby names website tht collects data on the names that parents give their children ech year.

For this analysis I will use MySQL, Windows functions, CTEs.

## Scenario
The baby names website is about to release their annual baby names report. 

## Goal
I have been asked to dig into the baby names data to produce some interesting findings about bby names over the years to share in the report.

During the analysis I'm going to answer the following questions:

1. What were the most popular baby names of each decade? How does this change over time?

2. Which baby names had the biggest jumps and drops in popularity?

3. Are there differences in which names are given to boys vs girls vs both over time?

4. Are there differences in baby name popularity based on the region in the United States?

## Objectives
1. Track changes in name popularity
2. Compare popularity across decades
3. Compare popularity across regions
4. Dig into some unique names
