## Build an interactive report

My fourth and final objective is to design an interactive report that the company leadership team can use to explore performance by store and over time.

So what trends and patterns can we see from this report? 
So as we start exploring this data kind of starting high level, we can really see a few patterns and trends emerge. And like we saw early on revenue has increased pretty steadily up until about 2020. Then it took a huge hit in April, 2020, and never really recovered from there. 
If we filtered on online stores, we can see that trend:

If we clear that filter, we can see kind of the overall trend here as well. 
And the other kind of time series pattern that's emerging quite clearly are these major dips, which appear to happen every April. So something is going on in April. Either the store is closing down or they're not running promotions.

Another thing we start to see as we kind of page throughby year is this delivery day number getting better and better year over year.
So 7.3 days in 2016 and 3.8 days in 2021. 
So that's really nice pattern that we can call out.

And if we look of the category level detail here, we can see that in 2021 computers really drive the bulk of the revenue. And if we go back in time, we can see that's been the leader going all the way back to 2019, 2018, 2017, but definetely less of a gap between computersand the next highest categories like home appliances and TV.

The next steps I might consider to drill into some product level or product subcategory level detail here. I might want to calculate some additional measures or metrics to show things like profits or margins. And I could break this down in different ways by geo location or by certain customer attributes as well.
