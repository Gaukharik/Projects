## Profile & prepare the data 

My first objective is to ingest the data from raw CSV files, conduct some data profiling, feature engineering and QA, and build a custom calendar to track performance by day, week, month, quarter and year.

1. Connect to the Sales CSV file and profile the data. How many orders were recorded? Over what time period? Is there anything interesting about delivery dates? Add a TransactionKey field to uniquely identify each row.

I imported Sales CSV through Power Query:

Then I checked columns quality:

Everything seem correct, except Delivery Date column, which has 86% empty values. 

If we uncheck the null values in Delivery Date column, then we can see that only 0 values appear in StoreKey column. We don't know what does it mean yet, as we haven't loaded store csv file yet. But we need to keep in mind this fact. To summurize the only store that has valued delivery dates is store 0.

To answer the question "How many were recorded?" I will use column profile option.
By navigating to Order Number column, we can see that there were 26326 orders.

The orders were made between 2016-01-01 and 2021-02-20.

And now let's add TransactionKey field (the primary key)

2. Connect to the Products CSV file and profile the data. What does the company sell? How many distinct categories and subcategories do you see?

What does the company sell?

Seems like the company sells 8 distinct product categories, such as home appliances, computers, cameras and camcoders, cell phones, TV and Video, games and toys, audio, music, movies and audio books. The most popular category is home appliances.

And there 32 distinct product subcategories:

The most popular subcategory is computer accessories, followed by lamps. 

There are no empty values in the entire table.


3. Connect to the Stores CSV file and profile the data. How many stores does Maven Electronics operate? Do you notice any that arenâ€™t like the others?



4. Connect to the Exchange_Rates CSV file and profile the data. What information does this table contain, and how could it be used?

5. Connect to the Customers CSV file and profile the data. How many customers has the company served? Where are customers primarily located?

6. Remove the Zip Code column, and transform the City field to capitalize the first letter of each word.

7. Add a new column to calculate Customer Age in years, then add a conditional column to calculate Age Range, where >60 = "Senior", >30 = "Adult" and >18 = "Young Adult".

8. Create a Calendar table that contains a list of contiguous dates (no gaps) and reflects the same date range as the Sales table, then add new columns for Day Name, Start of Week/Month/Quarter, and Year.
