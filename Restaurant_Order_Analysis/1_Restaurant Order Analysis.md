# Restaurant Order Analysis

I've just been hired as a Data Analust for the Taste of the World Cafe, a restaurant that has diverse menu offerings and serves generous portions.

For this analysis I will use MySQL.

## Scenario
The Taste of the World Cafe debuted a new menu at the start of the year. 

## Goal
I have been asked to dig into the customer data to see which menu items are doing well / not well and what the top customers seem to like best.

During the analysis I'm going to answer the following questions:

1. What were the least and most ordered items? What categories were they in?

2. What do the highest spend orders look like? Which items did they buy and how much did they spend?

3. Were there certain times that had more or less orders?

4. Which cuisines should we focus on developing more menu items for based on the data?

## Objectives
1. Explore the menu_items table to get an idea of what's on the new menu
2. Explore the order_details table to get the idea of the data that's been collected
3. Use both tables to understand how customers are reacting to the new menu

## Data Overview
A quarter's worth of orders from a fictitious restaurant serving international cuisine, including the date and time of each order, the items ordered, and additional details on the type, name and price of the items.

Multiple tables. # of records 12,266. # of fields 8.
